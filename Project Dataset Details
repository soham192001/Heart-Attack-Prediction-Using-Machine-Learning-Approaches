# Heart-Attack-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Approaches
Improving people's ability to detect the early warning signals of a heart attack is one of the most important factors in the process of reducing death rates throughout the world. The study of the clinical data takes into account a very important condition known as cardiovascular disease. When it comes to making an accurate forecast, this condition is one of the most important factors that needs to be taken into consideration first. It has the potential to be of tremendous use to medical practitioners to be able to forecast heart attacks using data science and machine learning (ML). It is feasible to take into account a number of different risk variables all at once while conducting an investigation of this kind. Diabetes, high blood pressure, and irregular pulse rhythms are just examples of the risk factors that might contribute to heart disease. The purpose of this study is to improve the accuracy of diagnosis for cardiac illnesses via the use of machine learning to its greatest potential and to its fullest potential.


Dataset columns:

age: The person’s age in years
sex: The person’s sex (1 = male, 0 = female)
cp: chest pain type
— Value 0: asymptomatic
— Value 1: atypical angina
— Value 2: non-anginal pain
— Value 3: typical angina
trestbps: The person’s resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
chol: The person’s cholesterol measurement in mg/dl
fbs: The person’s fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false)
restecg: resting electrocardiographic results
— Value 0: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes’ criteria
— Value 1: normal
— Value 2: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
thalach: The person’s maximum heart rate achieved
exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (‘ST’ relates to positions on the ECG plot. See more here)
slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment — 0: downsloping; 1: flat; 2: upsloping
0: downsloping; 1: flat; 2: upsloping
ca: The number of major vessels (0–3)
thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia Value 0: NULL (dropped from the dataset previously
Value 1: fixed defect (no blood flow in some part of the heart)
Value 2: normal blood flow
Value 3: reversible defect (a blood flow is observed but it is not normal)
target: Heart disease (1 = no, 0= yes)
